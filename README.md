# Putz- & BÃ¼gelteufelchen Employees App

This is the pubt.employees MVP. First we want to have a small crud application, which
is used to be served by some fake employer data. As soon as there is a pubt.empoyees backend, we will connect this backend to the React App.

## Prerequisites for local development environment

To prepare your local computer to be ready for development, you just need to install the follwoing prerequisites:

- git
